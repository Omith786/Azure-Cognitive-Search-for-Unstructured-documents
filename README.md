# Azure-Cognitive-Search-for-Unstructured-documents

This project is an AI-powered search engine built on Azure Cognitive Search, designed to help users efficiently find information within large collections of unstructured documents. The aim was to demonstrate how cloud-based search services can transform raw text, PDFs, and other unstructured data into a searchable, actionable resource.

The system leverages Azureâ€™s cognitive skills to extract metadata, key phrases, and semantic meaning from documents. Users can then perform queries using natural language or keyword-based searches, with the engine returning highly relevant results. Unlike traditional search systems, this setup can understand context, handle variations in terminology, and surface documents that may not contain the exact search phrase but are still highly relevant.

What makes this project unique is the combination of AI-driven understanding with enterprise-scale search capabilities. The pipeline can handle large datasets, automatically index new documents, and provide analytics on query trends. It is both a demonstration of how modern search technologies work and a practical tool for anyone dealing with information-heavy environments like research repositories, internal knowledge bases, or corporate documentation systems.

Beyond search functionality, the project highlights the flexibility of RAG-style integration, allowing AI models to augment search results with summarisation, recommendations, or insights extracted directly from the content. This makes it not just a retrieval system, but an intelligent assistant capable of guiding users to the information they need quickly and accurately.
